# StoryBoard — agent handoff (Codex / Cursor / others)

This document orients an autonomous coding agent so work continues without losing context. **Authoritative run instructions** remain in [`developer-runbook.md`](developer-runbook.md) and the root [`README.md`](../README.md).

## Product and remote

- **Product name:** StoryBoard (use everywhere; not a codename).
- **Public repo:** [https://github.com/rupret007/StoryBoard](https://github.com/rupret007/StoryBoard)
- **Stack:** pnpm monorepo — `apps/web` (Next.js 16), `apps/api` (NestJS 11 + Fastify), `packages/shared`, `packages/ui`; PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7; Prisma 7; BullMQ.

## Delivery state (what already exists)

Phases referenced in **README** / **docs** reflect what was built (the file [`.cursor/plans/storyboard-master-plan.md`](../.cursor/plans/storyboard-master-plan.md) is an **older roadmap**; trust the README phase bullets and this list for “current” scope).

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Scaffold, infra, Prisma, migrations | Done |
| Venues, contacts, booking opportunities, tasks | Done |
| Booking profile, one-market prospecting, prospect conversion | Done |
| Approval-gated pitch campaigns + linked follow-up tasks | Done |
| Market sprints + approval-gated immediate campaign delivery | Done |
| Bounded adaptive booking advisor (optional OpenAI; review-only) | Done |
| Tracked Gmail campaign replies + approval-gated negotiation drafts | Done; deployment-gated pending restricted-scope compliance |
| Cross-functional Manager intake, goals, memory, briefs, chat, recommendations | Done; executable idempotent 90-day starter plans, persistent multi-turn conversation, intent-aware fallback, strict evidence rejection, reviewed outcome learning/cooldowns, correctable memory, append-only goal progress, owner/timeline-aware plan health, and owner-run offline eval gate |
| Events, availability, show advance, songs/setlists, projects | Done; structured operations workspace, actionable gig editor, phone day-of view, and shared evidence-backed show-readiness scoring shipped |
| Release/content/tour/business execution | Done; idempotent dated milestone templates, owners/status, metrics/assets/budget, derived readiness, focused workspace, and Manager integration shipped |
| Offers, reviewed templates, PDF snapshots, invoices/manual payments, settlements | Internal workflow done; binary Drive/Gmail attachment and provider payment/signature adapters deferred |
| One-command local container bundle | Done (Docker Compose v2; internal web→API service URL verified; allocate 2 GB) |
| Approvals + execution (Gmail drafts, calendar holds, drive folder) | Done |
| Command bar + `POST /commands/execute` (NL + structured intents) | Done |
| Operator auth (Google OIDC), session cookie, memberships (`owner` / `member` / `viewer`) | Done |
| Invites, onboarding, Team UI, CSRF `Origin`/`Referer` guard | Done |
| Per-artist Google integration (encrypted), adapter registry | Done |
| Workflow jobs: invites, approval notify, digests, overdue/stale scans | Done |
| Notifications page, prefs, escalation thresholds | Done |
| Telegram **outbound** urgent alerts + operational intelligence (`GET /dashboard/insights`) | Done (5A) |
| Telegram **inbound** `/start` registration webhook + `TelegramRegistrationToken` | Done (5B) |
| Tests | Compiled `node:test` (56 API cases) plus opt-in Postgres integration coverage for tenant links, idempotent Manager intake/90-day plans, memory correction, goal progress/health, feedback/cooldowns/eval promotion and pass/fail runs, multi-turn isolation, confirmed-event idempotency, merged event schedule validation, day-of isolation/current-next derivation, project milestone idempotency/isolation/readiness, availability/advance, prospect/campaign delivery, payment replay, settlement math/PDF snapshots, roles, Telegram binding, and audits. Chromium e2e resets the explicit test database and covers booking acquisition plus first-use Manager intake → visible plan → natural plan explanation → progress/eval → task ownership → actionable gig readiness → phone day-of task completion → release milestones/assets/budget → Manager verification → offer/agreement PDF → invoice/deposit → expense/settlement. Unit coverage verifies date-aware readiness, day-of finance/work pressure, tailored project templates, project risk, and grounded release answers. |

## Non-goals to preserve (unless product changes)

- Do not replace the stack.
- Do not build a general Telegram command bot or approvals-from-Telegram.
- Keep **mock fallbacks** when integrations are unset.
- Keep **owner-only** rules for escalation, Telegram settings, and registration-token issuance.
- Keep mutations **auditable** (`AuditService`).
- Gmail reads are limited to StoryBoard-created campaign threads; do not expand this into general inbox access.

## High-value entry points

| Task | Start here |
|------|------------|
| Auth / roles | `apps/api/src/auth/`, `role-policy.service.ts`, `session-auth.guard.ts` |
| Workflow + queue | `apps/api/src/workflow-automation/`, `apps/api/src/queue/storyboard-queue.service.ts` |
| Telegram outbound | `workflow-telegram.service.ts`, `urgent-channel.constants.ts` |
| Telegram inbound | `telegram-registration.service.ts`, `telegram-webhook.controller.ts`, `telegram-start-parse.ts` |
| Notifications API | `workflow-settings.controller.ts`, `workflow-notifications.controller.ts` |
| Prisma schema | `prisma/schema.prisma` (client output: `apps/api/src/generated/prisma/` — **gitignored**; run `pnpm db:generate`) |
| Booking acquisition | `apps/api/src/booking/booking-{profiles,prospects,campaigns}.*`, `apps/web/src/app/(app)/{prospects,booking-campaigns}/` |
| Booking advisor | `apps/api/src/advisor/`, `apps/web/src/app/(app)/advisor/` |
| Booking reply loop | `apps/api/src/booking/booking-replies.*`, `apps/web/src/app/(app)/booking-inbox/` |
| Manager OS | `apps/api/src/manager/`, `apps/web/src/app/(app)/manager/`, `apps/api/test/fixtures/manager-evals-v1.json` |
| Band operations | `apps/api/src/operations/`, `apps/web/src/app/(app)/operations/` |
| Web app API client | `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` (cookies + `x-artist-id`) |

## Environment (short list)

Copy [`.env.example`](../.env.example) to `.env`. Required for API boot include `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `WEB_URL`. **Telegram (optional):** `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`, `TELEGRAM_REGISTRATION_TTL_MINUTES`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Full table: [`telegram-alerts.md`](telegram-alerts.md), validation: `apps/api/src/config/env.validation.ts`.

## Quality gate (before merge)

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm manager:eval
```

With Postgres up: `pnpm db:migrate` after schema changes; always `pnpm db:generate` when `schema.prisma` changes.

## Suggested next work (not committed; pick with the user)

1. **Product validation:** Run Manager briefs, plan health, conversation, show advance, and manual deal/settlement workflows with real original and cover bands. Capture reviewed examples when recommendations are useful, wrong, or missing context; do not tune from synthetic scores alone.
2. **Release workflow:** Add a human-reviewed candidate registration/promotion workflow only when a real `manager_os_v4` exists. Preserve the invariant that evaluation never activates a version itself.
3. **Connected delivery:** Add binary Drive/Gmail document delivery only after real provider acceptance testing. Keep external work approval-gated; do not add scraping, general inbox access, or autonomous sends.
4. **Runtime/tests:** Define queue-worker deployment, cursor pagination/query limits, and metrics before horizontal scale. Add mobile/offline resilience only after real day-of field testing.

## Cursor-only artifacts

`.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/commands/`, `.cursor/plans/` are editor helpers; Codex may ignore them. **Docs under `docs/` and this file** are tool-agnostic.
